## Chapter 2: Principles of Shaping

> When we shape the work, we need to do it at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete.

Do not define too much detail too early, so as to leave designers room for creativity. It's hard for people to design something different if you’re giving them something concrete from the start. 

Do not define projects in a few words (e.g. ‘build calendar view’), as it's too vague. You need context in order to decide which trade-offs to make.

Shaped work is *rough* (leaves room for designers to apply their judgment and expertise); it's *solved* (the main elements of the solution are there); and it's *bounded* (indicates what *not* to do, how much time to spend on it).

### Who shapes?

Shaping requires a combination of skills. It combines design work, technical work (judging what's possible, what's easy and what's hard), and strategic work (being critical about the problem you're trying to solve, e.g. what counts as success). If you're not a generalist, you should collaborate with others who have these skills.

### Two tracks

Shaping and building should be kept as separate tracks within a cycle to manage the risk and uncertainty involved in shaping.

### Steps to shaping

(These are covered in the next four chapters)

1. **Set boundaries.**
2. **Rough out the elements.**
3. **Address risks and rabbit holes.**
4. **Write the pitch**.
